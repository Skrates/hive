"""Portable GitHub-to-Hive review-loop router.

The cx53 self-hosted runners deliberately have a small host tool surface.  This
helper uses only Python's standard library and the credentials GitHub Actions
already injects; it does not depend on ``gh``, ``jq``, or a package manager.

Commands:

``route``
    Route one native Codex result: a submitted findings review goes to Talos;
    a bot-authored clean PR comment — in either verdict format Codex emits —
    goes to the authoring seat.  A Codex comment that looks like a verdict but
    cannot be routed is reported to Hive rather than dropped.  At the
    exhaustion gate the authoring seat gets the human gate and Theoros
    additionally gets a retrospective wake carrying the per-round history.
``nudge``
    Add one ``@codex review`` comment (with an exact-head marker) per stalled,
    unreviewed head until the bounded automatic loop is exhausted, and
    re-deliver a standing verdict once per authoritative same-head verdict
    whose seat never acted.  A wake fires exactly once from an event-driven
    path; a consumed
    wake with no new GitHub event is otherwise silence forever.  The scheduled
    exhaustion path posts the same human gate as ``route`` but does not wake
    Theoros: the retrospective requires findings still present on the exact
    current head, and this branch is entered only because that head has none.
``canary``
    Post a harmless Talos liveness wake for end-to-end verification.

        "*no-op* before naming a cause. Give repairs-per-round, never "
        "rounds alone. The two-range form is `git range-diff "
        "<old-base>..<old-head> <new-base>..<new-head>` over each head's "
        "full series — not `git diff <head>^ <head>`, which sees only the "
        "tip and can hide an earlier repair in a multi-commit burn. Use "
        "each round's recorded contemporaneous base as that head's series "
        "bound. The live `Base: <base-ref> @ <base-sha>` line is only the "
        "current declared base (never `origin/HEAD`); do not derive an "
        "earlier series from it. After the target is force-pushed or "
        "rebased, `git merge-base <old-head> <live-base>` can fall back "
        "before commits that belonged to the old base and corrupt the "
        "classification. If a compared head has no recorded "
        "contemporaneous base, report the gap and stop; do not invent a "
        "range:\n\n"

        "    git range-diff <old-base>..<old-head> "
        "<new-base>..<new-head>\n\n"

        "that common ancestor is the wrong range on a stacked or release "
        "branch. If a fetch fails, report the gap and stop; "
        "do not invent a range. `=` means replayed unchanged; `!` means "
        "read the diff before counting a repair. Head-to-head `git diff` "
        "is worthless across a rebase.\n"
        "2. **Name the structural cause** — which property was being "
        "established, and why repeated repair could not establish it. "
        '"No structural cause; the finding classes were independent" is a '
        "valid and valuable verdict — some PRs are simply large. Never "
        "conclude from absence: report the gap and stop.\n"
        "3. **Codify what generalises** — a new scar-assert on an existing "
        "skill (preferred; `skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md` §4 makes "
        "refinement the default) or, rarely, a new skill. Provenance is "

        "legitimate outcome — a one-off does not earn a corpus entry, and a "
        "corpus of noise is worse than a small one.\n"
        "4. **Post the verdict on the PR** so it is attached to the evidence, "
        "not only to this thread. Skill changes ride a review-ready PR to "
        "weave-doctrine; merge stays Hákon's word.\n\n"
